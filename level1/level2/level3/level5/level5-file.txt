Despite the typos we see in texts and social media, professional environments still value good grammar. For hiring managers, a command of grammar offers honest insight into an applicant’s intelligence, dedication, attention to detail, and professionalism, not to mention communication skills. Good grammar can even land you that promotion: According to a 2013 study, professionals who have been promoted six to nine times made 45 percent fewer grammar mistakes than those promoted one to four times. Learning the difference between there, their, and they’re isn’t just about speaking properly—it’s also a good career move!
