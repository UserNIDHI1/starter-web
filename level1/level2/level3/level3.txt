If you’re telling a story, fiction or nonfiction, you’ll need to break up the action into digestible segments so your reader doesn’t get confused. That’s the purpose of narrative paragraphs: they break up sequential actions into related chunks, with one leading into the next, so that the reader can remain focused on the storyline. They don’t use evidence or supporting arguments like the other paragraph types, but they still abide by the main rule of paragraphs about unity.
